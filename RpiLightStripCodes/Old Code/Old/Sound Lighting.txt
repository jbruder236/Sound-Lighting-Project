Have a potentiometer where its value determines how much to turn lights on 
(if python spits out 0-100 then the pot can decrease upper bound- so a reading of 80 now means 100% power to LED)


Red, Green, and Blue can each represent a range of the spectrum

Use small screen to have a visual of the frequency spectrum

Grab an aux cord so people can aux in and play music


Python notes:
py -3.6 -m pip install pyAudio (run in CMD)

^^This source is important - towards the bottom he determines which frequency is producing the loudest tone.
